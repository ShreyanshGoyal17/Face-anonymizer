# Face-anonymizer

In todayâ€™s technological world, where we have search engines like Clearview just for facial
recognition, it is important to restrict the accessibility to our faces and ensure the
fundamental right to privacy. This project is to work towards the anonymization of the faces
present in any live feed, captured videos, and photos. This was achieved by first detecting
the faces using the Haar Cascade algorithm and then turning the detected faces into a small
block for the data to be lost permanently and finally resizing it. Face Detection using Haar
feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective detection method used even today in various
places. The anonymization process is invariant to the movements and therefore, can keep
the face anonymous if it is in the frame.
